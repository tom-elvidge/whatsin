# whatsin

'Whats In?' allows you to quickly find out what ingredients are commonly included in a recipe so you don't have to trawl through recipe websites for ingredient ideas and suggestions.

## Development Environment

Change directory to the frontend (web), install the project requirements, and start the development server.

```bash
whatsin$ cd web
whatsin/web$ npm install
whatsin/web$ npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.
